# 51. N-Queens

# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

# Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

# Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

# Example 1:
# Input: n = 4
# Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
# Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above

# Example 2:
# Input: n = 1
# Output: [["Q"]]
