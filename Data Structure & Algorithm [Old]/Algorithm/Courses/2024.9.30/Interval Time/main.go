// We are given a set of n intervals, numbered 1 . . . n, each of which has a start time si and a finish time fi. For each interval, we want to compute a value p[i], which is the interval j with the latest finish time fj such that fj â‰¤ si; that is, the last-ending interval that finishes before interval i starts. If no intervals end before interval i begins, then p[i] = 0.
// Give an O(n log n) time algorithm that computes p[i] for all intervals. You may assume that the intervals are already sorted by finish time.
