# 322. Coin Change

# You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

# Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

# You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

# Example 1:
# Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

# Example 2:
# Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
# Output: -1

# Example 3:
# Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
# Output: 0
