# 518. Coin Change II

# You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

# Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.

# You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

# The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.

# Example 1:
# Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
# 5=5
# 5=2+2+1
# 5=2+1+1+1
# 5=1+1+1+1+1

# Example 2:
# Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

# Example 3:
# Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
# Output: 1
