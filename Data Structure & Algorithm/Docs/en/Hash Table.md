# Hash Table

## Introduction

Hash Table is a data structure which organizes data using hash functions in order to support quick insertion and search.

There are two different kinds of hash tables: hash set and hash map.

The hash set is one of the implementations of a set data structure to store no repeated values.

The hash map is one of the implementations of a map data structure to store (key, value) pairs.

It is easy to use a hash table with the help of standard template libraries. Most common languages such as Java, C++ and Python support both hash set and hash map.

By choosing a proper hash function, the hash table can achieve wonderful performance in both insertion and search.

## The Principle of Hash Table

As we mentioned in the introduction, Hash Table is a data structure which organizes data using hash functions in order to support quick insertion and search. In this article, we will take a look at the principle of the hash table.

The key idea of Hash Table is to use a hash function to map keys to buckets. To be more specific,

When we insert a new key, the hash function will decide which bucket the key should be assigned and the key will be stored in the corresponding bucket;
When we want to search for a key, the hash table will use the same hash function to find the corresponding bucket and search only in the specific bucket.

## Keys to Design a Hash Table

1. Hash Function

The hash function is the most important component of a hash table which is used to map the key to a specific bucket. In the example in the previous article, we use y = x % 5 as a hash function, where x is the key value and y is the index of the assigned bucket.

The hash function will depend on the range of key values and the number of buckets.

It is an open problem to design a hash function. The idea is to try to assign the key to the bucket as uniformly as you can. Ideally, a perfect hash function will be a one-one mapping between the key and the bucket. However, in most cases, a hash function is not perfect and it is a tradeoff between the amount of buckets and the capacity of a bucket.

2. Collision Resolution

Ideally, if our hash function is a perfect one-one mapping, we will not need to handle collisions. Unfortunately, in most cases, collisions are almost inevitable. For instance, in our previous hash function (y = x % 5), both 1987 and 2 are assigned to bucket 2. That is a collision.

A collision resolution algorithm should solve the following questions:

How to organize the values in the same bucket?
What if too many values are assigned to the same bucket?
How to search for a target value in a specific bucket?
These questions are related to the capacity of the bucket and the number of keys which might be mapped into the same bucket according to our hash function.

Let's assume that the bucket, which holds the maximum number of keys, has N keys.

Typically, if N is constant and small, we can simply use an array to store keys in the same bucket. If N is variable or large, we might need to use height-balanced binary search tree instead.
