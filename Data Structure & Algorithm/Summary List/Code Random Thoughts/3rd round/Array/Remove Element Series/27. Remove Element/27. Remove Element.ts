// 27. Remove Element

// Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

// Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

// Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
// Return k.

// Example 1:
// Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
// Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
// Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
// It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

// Example 2:
// Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
// Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
// Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
// Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
// It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

export function removeElement(nums: number[], val: number): number {
  let slow = 0;
  let fast = 0;

  while (fast < nums.length) {
    if (nums[fast] !== val) {
      const temp = nums[slow];
      nums[slow] = nums[fast];
      nums[fast] = temp;
      slow++;
    }
    fast++;
  }

  return slow;
}

// test
const res = removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3);
console.log(res);
